    <p><strong>Chicken Kiev</strong>, aka chicken Kyiv, is one of the best chicken breast 
        recipes I have ever made. This comforting dish comes from Ukraine. Every single bite is bursting with the delicious 
        flavor of tender and juicy chicken, garlic, fresh herbs, and melting butter. Serve over creamy mashed potatoes for an 
        authentic Ukrainian dinner.</p>
    <p>Though the recipe is a bit involved, each of the steps is fairly straightforward, and the end result is worth the effort.
         First, make the garlic butter filling and refrigerate until firm. Then pound chicken breasts, stuff with the chilled butter 
         and roll the chicken up. Chill the rolled chicken for 30 minutes. Once chilled, dip the 
    chicken in turn in the flour, egg, and lastly, the breadcrumbs. Transfer the breaded chicken to the freezer and chill until it’s
     firm to handle. Shallow-fry the chicken for two to three minutes and then finish the cooking in the oven. Let rest for 2 minutes 
     and serve hot!  </p>

                     <h3> Steps to make Chicken Kiev:</h3>
                       <ol>
                        <li><p>In a bowl, mix 6 tablespoons softened butter with 2 teaspoons finely
                             chopped parsley, 2 minced garlic cloves, and ¼ teaspoon salt until 
                             well combined.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Place the garlic butter on parchment paper and roughly shape it into a 4x2 ½-inch
                               rectangle. Refrigerate 
                               until firm. Once chilled, cut in half lengthwise to form two even bars.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Place the chicken breasts smooth side down between two pieces of plastic wrap.
                             Use a meat mallet to pound the chicken to an even ¼-inch thickness. Sprinkle each 
                             side with salt and black pepper.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Place each pounded chicken breast on a large piece of plastic wrap and put a bar
                             of garlic butter in the center. Tightly roll up the chicken around the butter, folding the sides in over the butter,
                              then twist the ends of the plastic wrap to create a
                             log shape. Transfer to the freezer for 30 minutes until the surface is just firm to
                             touch but not frozen solid.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Place 1 lightly whisked egg, ¼ cup flour, and 1 cup panko breadcrumbs in separate bowls. 
                            Unwrap the chicken. First, coat the chilled chicken in flour, shaking off excess. Next,
                            coat in egg and drip off excess. Finally, coat in breadcrumbs and lightly press to adhere.
                             Make sure to coat the ends too.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Place the breaded chicken on a plate and transfer to the freezer for 30 
                            minutes until fairly firm to handle but not frozen solid.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 °F. Place a rack on a baking sheet and set aside.</p></li>
                        <li><p>In a Dutch oven or cast-iron skillet, heat 4 cups oil to 375 °F. Shallow-fry the chicken, 
                             turning once or twice, until golden, 2-3 minutes.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Place the chicken on a rack and bake for 12 to 15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and registers
                             150 ºF on an instant-read thermometer.
                             Make sure to pierce only the top of the chicken to avoid butter leakage. 
                             Once baked, let rest for 2 minutes.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley and serve hot!</p></li>
