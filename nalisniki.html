    <p>These homemade <strong>Nalesniki – Ukrainian Crepes</strong>, aka nalysnyky, are thin crepes rolled up with a savory cheese filling
         and baked in the oven until golden brown and deliciously tender. If you crave comfort food for breakfast or brunch,
          you will love these. Truly comforting and a real joy to eat!</p>
          <P>The batter for Ukrainian nalesniki is traditionally made with flour, eggs, milk, water, and a pinch of salt.
               The filling includes cottage cheese, egg yolks, a little heavy cream, a few snippets of fresh dill, and a pinch of salt.
                Once filled, the crepes are rolled and baked in the oven.
               Serve these delicious nalesniki while still warm with melted butter, a dollop of sour cream, or yogurt.</P>

                   <h3>Steps to make Nalesniki – Ukrainian Crepes</h3>

                      <ol><li>Preheat the oven to 250 °F. 
                          <li>Beat eggs.<em>(In a bowl, use a hand mixer to beat 4 large eggs until light and fluffy.)</em></li>
                                <li> Add in 1 cup whole milk, 6 tablespoons cold water, 1 cup all-purpose flour,<br> 
                            and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt and beat until smooth.</br> </li>
                        <li> Heat and lightly butter a 6-inch non-stick pan on medium heat.
                             <br>Pour about ¼ cup of batter into the pan and swirl</br> 
                            the pan to help the batter spread evenly. Cook the crepes one <br>side only for about 1 minute or
                             until lightly browned. Don’t turn over. Repeat until you have 12 crepes,<br> buttering the pan each time.
                              Stack the crepes and keep them warm in the oven at 250 °F.</br></li>

                             1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill weed and mix to combine.</br></li>
